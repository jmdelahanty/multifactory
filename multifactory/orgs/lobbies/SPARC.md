# History

> The idea of SPARC was presented at the 1997 annual meeting of the [Association of Research Libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Research_Libraries "Association of Research Libraries").https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_Publishing_and_Academic_Resources_Coalition#cite_note-groen-5)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_Publishing_and_Academic_Resources_Coalition#cite_note-6) Kenneth Frazier(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_Publishing_and_Academic_Resources_Coalition#cite_note-7) librarian at the University of Wisconsin, proposed that attendees at the meeting develop a fund to create a new publication model for academic journals wherein many libraries contributed to that fund, and from that fund, the contributors would create new publications on some model which lowered the costs of all journals

> SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) works to enable the open sharing of research outputs and educational materials in order to democratize access to knowledge, accelerate discovery, and increase the return on our investment in research and education. As a catalyst for action, SPARC focuses on collaborating with other stakeholders—including authors, publishers, libraries, students, funders, policymakers and the public—to build on the opportunities created by the Internet, promoting changes to both infrastructure and culture needed to make open the default for research and education.
