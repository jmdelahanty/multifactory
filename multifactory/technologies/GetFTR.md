# Description

> Eva is a researcher at a university. She is using her usual online research platform to search for journal articles on the latest findings in her field.

> The platform she’s using **has integrated with GetFTR**, and in the past Eva has used [SeamlessAccess.org](https://seamlessaccess.org/ "Seamless Access") to access research articles while off campus.

> The research **platform can detect Eva’s institutional affiliation** and can use GetFTR to place an indicator next to any subscription-based articles that she can access.

> She wants to read a full journal article, so clicks on the GetFTR indicator

> If Eva has recently authenticated at her institution she’ll go straight to the article. If she hasn’t, she will be directed to her university login page to check her credentials. **No need to stop first at the publisher website, no decisions to make about which login to use.**
