Central Message:
> It is important to underscore upfront that we are not opposing the use of data and data
> analytics in academic institutions. This project is aimed at ensuring that academic
> institutions retain control over the use of data and data analytics, that the use of data
> and data analytic tools is consistent with the goals of the academic community and that
> academic institutions are properly equipped to deal with the risks and implications posed
> by the rising amount of data being collected, analyzed, and used. pp 8


# Summary Statement from Authors

*"Academic publishing is udnergoing a major transition as some of its leaders are moving from a content provision to a data analytics business"*

- Research assessment
- Productivity tools
- OLMS

In apparent effort to be fundamental to the conducting of end-to-end business of universities. Could:

>invisibly and strategecially influence, and perhaps exer control, over key university decisions (like) student assessment to research integrity to financial planning... (This) represents a potential multi-billion...(perhaps) multi-trillion (dollar market) when the value of intellectual property is factored in, but its capture and use could significantly reduce institutions and scholars' rights to their data and related intellectual property. pp 3


## The Academic Publishing Industry in 2018
### Background
"At first glance, academic publshing should have shared the traits of most [[Business-to-Business Model]] (B2B) media businesses after the transition to digital products and services:"
- Concentrated supply protected by scale economies in sales and distribution with high barriers to entry
- Pricing power driven by oligopolistic supply with inelastic demands
- Rising profitability

"Fault Lines appearing": Driven by media usage behavior (ie cable TV users "cutting the cord")
- Librarians are taking tougher stances when negotiating renewal of scholarly journal collections, more willing to let them expire
- Digital dissmenination has enabled piracy to play an increasing role in the form of 
[[Gray Markets and Parallel Imports]] as well as unlicensed downloads of digital copies

Response of industry:
- Legal action
- Lower prices or at least rate of price increases to reflect changing elasticity of demand
- New business models like hybrid journals that maintain subscriptions but accept Open Access Publications
- "Inclusive access" to textbooks

#### Transformation to data analytics companies: Elsevier, Pearson, Cengage

Build analytics on top of scientific content that can be monetized without abandoning traditional conent business
- Very large and profitable relative to toal size of business
- Without content they have a hard time to build credible data offerings
	- What makes a "credible" data offering? This sounds like a widely applicable thing in science generally at the level of different labs, companies, institutions, funding agencies, etc...


>Until now, these companies were – at worst – seen by institutions as an annoyance for selected communities within academia. Librarians complained about the cost of periodicals and talked about a “serials crisis”, but the impact on the overall budget of a university was well below half of a percentage point. Similarly, the high cost of textbooks was an issue for students, and in particular those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, but scholarships and some forms of financial aid, as well as the used textbook market, tended to mitigate the problem. - pp 7

Shifting services into data analytics/monitoring signals a move to control core activities of academic institutions as well as generates legal and reputational risks for institutions too pending data governance, hacks, etc.
